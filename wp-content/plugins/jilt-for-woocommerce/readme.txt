Increase sales in your WooCommerce store by connecting to Jilt â€” save abandoned carts and send emails that make you money.

== Description ==

> **Requires: WooCommerce 3.0** or newer

Jilt is built from the ground up to help your store increase sales. This plugin connects Jilt to [WooCommerce](http://www.woocommerce.com) to bring powerful, automated lifecycle emails to your store.

= A complete abandoned cart solution =

[Jilt's abandoned cart recovery solution](https://jilt.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin-listing&utm_content=cta-jilt-abandoned-cart-recovery-app&utm_campaign=jilt-woocommerce-wordpress-plugin) helps your eCommerce store **recover lost revenue** due to cart abandonment. Jilt tracks when carts are abandoned on your store, then lets you send recovery emails to encourage the customers who abandoned these carts to complete the purchase.

Jilt has already helped merchants generate **over $50,000,000** in additional revenue! You can set up as many campaigns and recovery emails as you'd like, and customize the text and design of every email sent.

= Customize beautiful emails in minutes =

Jilt lets you send one or more emails automatically when events happen in your store. You can set up as many emails within a campaign as you'd like (e.g., send 3 recovery emails per abandoned cart, or a series of 4 emails in a welcome campaign).

You can also set up as many campaigns as you want &ndash; create a dedicated series of recovery emails for holidays, sales, or other company events. Build a complete set of lifecycle emails to communicate with customers from their first browsing experience through to repeat purchases.

Jilt's visual email builder helps you create emails that reflect your brand, and each campaign includes relevant starter content to get your emails up and running as soon as possible.

= Send automated post-purchase follow ups =

Jilt's [post-purchase follow up emails](https://jilt.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin-listing&utm_content=cta-jilt-post-purchase-followups&utm_campaign=jilt-woocommerce-wordpress-plugin) help you increase repeat sales. You've worked hard to gain new customers, so make the most of them! Send automated post-purchase emails once orders are completed to encourage leaving a review, providing feedback, or purchasing again.

You can also follow up over the long run. Win back inactive customers with replenishment and win-back email campaigns to increase lifetime value.

= Enhance your transactional emails =

Receipt emails are an amazing engagement opportunity, but WooCommerce order emails are really difficult to modify unless you can write code. Jilt helps you completely replace your WooCommerce order emails! Enhance your receipts and shipment notifications by using Jilt's visual email builder.

You can even leverage Jilt's advanced segmentation to send different versions of your order emails. Need to send different receipts for high value orders, or a different shipment notification for international orders? You can do it easily! Supercharge your transactional emails with Jilt.

= Built for site performance =

Rather than storing abandoned carts and contact data in your site's database, you can offload this data to Jilt. This ensures that you can track data over time and get valuable insights into cart abandonment and revenue from your emails, while your site **stays speedy** and doesn't get bogged down with tons of abandoned cart or email tracking data.

5. Save your settings!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need anything else to use this plugin? =

Yes, a free Jilt account is required to connect to your WooCommerce store. You can [learn more about Jilt pricing here](https://jilt.com/pricing/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin-listing&utm_content=cta-faq-learn-more-about-jilt-pricing-here&utm_campaign=jilt-woocommerce-wordpress-plugin) for our paid accounts.

= What are all of the types of emails I can send? =

You can send almost any email you'd like with Jilt! Here's just a sampling of the types of emails you can enable:

- Cart abandonment recovery
- Welcome new customers or first-time purchasers
- Thank your repeat purchasers or reward your VIP or high volume customers
- Win back your inactive customers or send them replenishment reminders
- Ask customers for product reviews after purchase, or send a follow up email series
- Replace your order emails with customized receipts, shipment notifications, refund notifications, cancellation confirmations, and order completed emails
- Send broadcast emails to your entire contact list to announce new products, sales, or offers
- With **WooCommerce Memberships**, send automated emails based on your members' data (welcome emails, renewal reminders, expiration win-backs, and more!)
- With **WooCommerce Subscriptions**, send automated emails around a subscription schedule (welcome emails, upcoming renewals, cancellation win-backs, trial ending notifications, etc.)

= When is a cart "abandoned"? =

A cart is considered abandoned if a customer has added items to the cart, but has not checked out or shown any cart activity for at least 15 minutes (ie adding more items). At this point, Jilt starts the timers for your recovery emails.

= Which customers will be emailed for abandoned carts? =

Any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails from Jilt. Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address in the checkout process will also be sent recovery emails.

= When will post-purchase emails be sent? =

Most post-purchase emails are triggered upon order **completion**, as this tells us your store is "done" with the order. Once an order is marked "completed", Jilt will schedule post-purchase emails on the schedule you've configured in your campaign. However, this can be customized to suit your needs.

= Can I include unique coupon codes in my emails? =

Yep! Jilt can automatically create unique coupon codes and include them in your automated emails. This gives you a proven and powerful means of increasing conversion rates and generating more orders!
